Separate table for admin
Separate table for user, refer FK from student
Should admin be a student


user table
username, password, role
mt2012138, *****, student
admin01, ****, admin

student table
name, login time, photo, dob, int id, ID (FK)

user 
	username, password, role (admin/student)

student 
	stuID, stuName, stuPhoto, stuLoggedin, stuRollNo, stuPassword, stuDOB

admin
	username, password

mapStudentInterest table
	mapID, stuID, intID


enrollduration
	enrID, strDate, endDate, subID, semID

 
1. We should create one more table(enrollduration) in order to check if the enrolment time is completed. i.e a student should be able to enroll within the enrollment period only.
This table should be an association table between subject table and semester table with attributes enrStartTime and enrEndTime

2. Create admin table for authentication of administrators

3. Create an association table b/w subject and faculty
This table is used in view faculties per subject usecase and in some other usecases where faculty is involved.

4. Modify existing subject table.-- remove faulty id as a subject can be taught by more than one faculty

5. Naming conventions and coding standards should be followed strictly

6. The uploaded Database scripts should be checked and corected if there are any errors. (in fact there are minor errors :))
